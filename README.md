# Creating Interactive Visualizations using Plotly in Python
## Introduction
In today’s world, every second the data keeps on getting bigger and bigger. In order to understand the data quickly and to draw insights, data visualization becomes necessary.

For e.g. consider a case where you are asked to illustrate crucial sales aspects (like sales performance, target, revenue, acquisition cost, etc.) from huge amounts of sales data, which one would you prefer:

1. Exploring the data using Excel (or spreadsheets) and keeping track of each sales aspect manually.
2. Exploring the data using different types of sales graphs and charts
Obviously, you would prefer graphs and charts. So data visualization plays a key role in data exploration and data analysis.

## Data Visualization is the technique to represent the data/information in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables the stakeholders and decision-makers to analyze and explore the data visually and uncover deep insights.

“Visualization gives you answers to questions you didn’t know you had.” – Ben Schneiderman

# Benefits of Data Visualization
Helps in data analysis, data exploration and makes the data more understandable.
Summarises the complex quantitative information in a small space.
Helps in discovering the latest trends, hidden patterns in the data.
Identifies the relationships/correlations between the variables.
Helps in examining the areas that need attention or improvement.
# Why Plotly?
There are several libraries available in Python like Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc. for data visualization. But they render only the static images of the charts/plots and due to this, many crucial things get lost in the visualization. Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could interact better with the charts by hovering in (or) zooming in? Plotly allows us to do the same.

Plotly is an open-source data visualization library to create interactive and publication-quality charts/graphs.
Plotly offers implementation of many different graph types/objects like line plot, scatter plot, area plot, histogram, box plot, bar plot, etc.
Plotly supports interactive plotting in commonly used programming languages like Python, R, MATLAB, Javascript, etc.
In this Notebook (https://github.com/Awais1161/Plotly/blob/main/Plotly.ipynb), most commo graphs used for data visualization are covered.
